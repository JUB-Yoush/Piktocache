# Piktocache
Created during UWaterloo's 2023 Hack the North Event, we took upon ourselves to create a unique social experience in urban spaces in which users who are under the same IP address. Inspired by our nostalgia for Nintendo's DS Piktochat feature as well as the unique quality of geocaching, we combined these experiences to reshape the way that people can interact in urban spaces.

## How does Piktocache work?
Piktocache is a browser based chat, where people can leave behind or discover messages as well as have brief encounters with strangers. It also contains the ability to both send messages as well as drawings into the chat. 

Being a niche topic, our website is geared towards a specific userbase that is interested in digital geocaching or even the return of a Nintendo Piktochat-esque chatroom. In trying to foster low-risk social encounters in a world where individuals become more socially isolated, this is a new way to interact with strangers and provide a way to socialize anonymously in a public space! Other than searching for those online on the website at the same time, users can also leave behind messages, which allows for the ability for users to join networks and be able to find messages left behind from previous chatters passing by. This means that users can either engage in the search for messages left behind, leave their own clues and messages, and in doing so also leaving behind a digital artefact for others to find.
